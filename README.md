# Spam_Email_Detector
- see DS1001 Final Project Report.pdf for detail.

### Introduction:
This program is build with python, the related modules used in this project including CountVectorize, TfidfVectorize, SelectKBest, BernoulliNB, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier and metrics in Sklearn.
* 1, Conducted Data cleaning and feature selection using python modules including numpy and pandas
* 2, Processed raw data of email text into word tokens based on Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF in the ScikitLearn module.
* 3, Selected features using Chi-Square selection and max number limitation.
* 4, Built the models with Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Reggression and Random Forest
* 5, Developed own evaluate metrics based on ROC and confusion matrix, by given penalty score to false positive.
* 6, Visualized the evaluation result with Matplotlib module
